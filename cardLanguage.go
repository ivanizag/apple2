Language card with 16 extra kb for the Apple ][ and  ][+
Manual: http://www.applelogic.org/files/LANGCARDMAN.pdf

The language card doesn't have ROM for Cx00. It would not
be used in slot 0 anyway.

Note also that language cards for the Apple ][ had ROM on
board to replace the main board F8 ROM with Autostart. That
was not used/needed on the Apple ][+. As this emulates the
Apple ][+, it is not considered. For the Plus it is often
referred as Language card but it is really a 16 KB Ram card,


"When RAM is deselected, the ROM on the Language card is selected for
the top 2K ($F800-$FFFF), and the ROM on the main board is selected
for $D000-$F7FF.

Power on RESET initializes ROM to read mode and RAM to write mode,
and selects the second 4K bank to map $D000-$DFFF."

Writing to the softswitch disables writing in LC? Saw that
somewhere but doing so fails IIe self check.
