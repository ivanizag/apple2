- Tooltip on widgets. As there is a Hoverable, it would be nice to have TooltipableÂ¿? and check on mouse move.
```
type Tooltipable interface {
	Tooltip() string
}
```

- Text on the toolabar items, at least tooltips
- Missing keys for Pause and for PrintScreen.
- RunOnMain()
- Buttons with state: pressed, disabled
